# Blade A
This data-set corresponds to the CFD studies carried out on Blade A in Seshadri et al. 2019, comprising of 25 design variables and 2 objective functions (efficiency and pressure ratio).

Main points to note:
----------------------
- There are a total of 548 data points corresponding to a CFD-based design of experiments (DoE).
- Design parameters have been non-dimensionalized to lie between [-1,1].
- The DoE was sampled using independent uniformly distributed random samples.
- Efficiency and pressure ratio outputs have been non-dimensionalized.
